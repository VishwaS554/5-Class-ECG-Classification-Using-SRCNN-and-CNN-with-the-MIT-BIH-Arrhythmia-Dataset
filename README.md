# 5-Class-ECG-Classification-Using-SRCNN-and-CNN-with-the-MIT-BIH-Arrhythmia-Dataset

Detecting arrhythmia cannot be achieved without the aid of computer-based ECG analysis. The objective of this study is to present a novel DL (Deep Learning) technique for the automatic classification of ECG signals, aimed at improving the detection of arrhythmia. Utilizing a dataset of 23 recordings selected from a collection of 4000 samples from a diverse patient population, we developed a Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) to categorize ECG signals into five distinct classes. The appropriate classifier was chosen based on the input data characteristics and the desired accuracy. Our DL approach demonstrated a diagnostic performance comparable to that of cardiologists, with the SRCNN showing significant potential in reducing misdiagnosis and improving accuracy. The model achieved an accuracy of 87.3\%, which is notably high for an emerging research network. This paper's innovation lies in the application of SRCNN for predictive ECG classification, highlighting its effectiveness in automated arrhythmia detection.
